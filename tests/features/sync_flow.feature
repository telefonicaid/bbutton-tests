Feature: Complete path E2E functionality Sync-Async / Sync-Sync
  In order to check if a blackbutton that can order a product
  In a Service servicea1a and Subservice testpizza
  As a client has SYNC BlackButtons: devicea1a_sa_03 and devicea1a_ss_04
  I should validate the ability of the platform to process the buttons requests to a Sync or Async third party


  @ft-syncflow @sf-button-flows @sf-party-sync
  Scenario Outline: SC1 client push the button in the SYNC mode, and third party is SYNC
    Given a Client of "<SERVICE>" and a ThirdParty called "<SERVICEPATH>"
    When the subservice is created in the "ORC"

    And a valid token is retrieved for user "<SERVICE_ADMIN>" and password "<SERVICE_PWD>"
    Then device "<DEVICE_ID>" should be listed under service and subservice
    And the button "<DEVICE_ID>" is pressed in mode "<SYNC_MODE>" the IOTA should receive the request
    And the ThirdParty "<TP_NAME>" changed the status to "<OP_RESULT>"
